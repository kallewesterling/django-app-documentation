# Creating a New Workshop

So you want to build a new workshop for the DHRI Curriculum? Great! We've create an accessible guide for you [here](creating-new-workshop.md).

# Forking Workshop

Once there is a workshop built for the DHRI, you will want to fork it into [the central curriculum](https://www.github.com/DHRI-Curriculum). To do so, you need to have administrative (forking) access to the DHRI-Curriculum. If you do not, our instructions will not work.

Instructions are available [here](forking-workshop.md).
