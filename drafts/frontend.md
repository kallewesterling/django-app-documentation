# Common mistakes
- No need to treat the `frontmatter.md` and `theory-to-practice.md` as prose. They're automatically ingested and don't need (should not have) language besides what's necessary.
        - For example, in "Frontmatter," no need to introduce the sections.
- Be descriptive when you create a link in any of the markdown files.
        - Don't write "For more information, see [this file](link)" but instead "For more information, see the [Python user manual's entry on lists](link)."
- Avoid jargon
        - Explain hard words. Avoid verb like "zipping" (in favor of more explanatory terms such as "compressing")
