# Cloning the workshop to the DHRI platform

Assuming that you’ve build the workshop in your local user (in my case, under the `kallewesterling` GitHub user), we now want to clone the workshop to the DHRI-Curriculum “user” on GitHub.

_This must be done by someone with fork access to DHRI-Curriculum._

1. Navigate to the new workshop on Github (say, `kallewesterling/javascript`)
2. Press the “Fork” button in the upper-right-hand corner.
3. A dialog should appear where you have the option of clicking “DHRI-Curriculum.” (If you do not, you don’t have fork access to `DHRI-Curriculum` on GitHub, and need to ask Lisa or Kalle for access.)
4. Press DHRI-Curriculum, and that should be it.

If you need to remove the fork, you can press the “Settings” tab, scroll down to the “Danger Zone,” and press “Delete this repository.” Since the repository was created not as part of the `DHRI-Curriculum`, this process won’t remove the “original” repository—only the fork under the `DHRI-Curriculum`.
