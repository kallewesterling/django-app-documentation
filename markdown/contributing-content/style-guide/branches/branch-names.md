# Branch names

Branch names of workshops and other content-oriented repositories (in `install`, `glossary`, etc.) should generally follow the convention `v1.0` or `v2.0` when they are in production. When you're creating "editing branches" where you will commit your suggested edits to a content-oriented repository, they should follow the convention `<desired upstream, like v2.0>-<your-username>-edits` (for instance, `v2.0-kallewesterling-edits`).
