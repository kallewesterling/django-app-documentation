# Template for `image.md`

Create a file named `image.md` in the root of your workshop's repository. Inside the file, copy and paste the following markdown and edit as you see fit. Please follow the guidelines below and only update the all-caps information in the markdown.

```md
![Header image for the NAME OF WORKSHOP workshop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USER/REPOSITORY/BRANCH/\_django-meta/header%403x.png)
```

Once you've added the `image.md` file, also make sure to add to your workshop's root directory, a folder called `_django-meta` and inside of it, add a file with the name `header@3x.png` that adheres to the image standard of the website. Preferably the image is of the size 610 x 1994px.
