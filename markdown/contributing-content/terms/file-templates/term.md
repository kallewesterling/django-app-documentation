# Template for `term.md`

Create a file named `<term>.md` (replace `<term>` with your term in all-lowercase, and `-` replacing any spaces in the term). Put the file inside the `terms` directory in a new editing branch for the `glossary` repository.

Inside the file, copy and paste the following markdown and edit as you see fit. Note that the `Readings`, `Tutorials`, and `Cheat sheets` headings are all optional.

```md
# <term>

Add the explanation of the term in this first paragraph, and then use as many paragraphs as you need.
