# The `ingest` command explained

Just like the `build` command, `ingest` is a "shortcut" that runs a number of commands, which can, just like the `build` commands parts, be run individually. The `ingest` command runs them all in the correct order:

1. ingestgroups
2. ingestusers
3. ingestglossary
4. ingestinstalls
5. ingestinsights
6. ingestworkshop
7. ingestsnippets
8. ingestblurbs
9. ingestprerequisite
