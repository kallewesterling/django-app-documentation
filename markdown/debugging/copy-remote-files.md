# Copy Remote Files For Debugging

Sometimes, you might want to check out files from the curriculum site on your local machine. An easy way to copy over SSH is the following command. In this case, we want to investigate a preloaded yaml file (generated by the `python manage.py buildworkshop --name git` command):

```sh
ssh dhinstit@dhinstitutes.org 'cat curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/_preload/_workshops/git/git.yml' > /Users/kallewesterling/Downloads/git.yml
```

If you want to make a copy of the current database for inspection, this is also a handy command:

```sh
ssh dhinstit@dhinstitutes.org 'cat curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/db.sqlite3' > /Users/kallewesterling/Downloads/db.sqlite3
```
