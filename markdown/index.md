# Welcome to the Documentation for the DHRI Curriculum website

<p class="lead">The Digital Humanities Research Institute (DHRI) is an intensive, community-oriented, and foundational approach to learning technical skills in service of humanities teaching and learning.</p>

This is the documentation page for how to contribute to the project with [a workshop](contributing-content/workshops/new.md), [a term](contributing-content/terms/new.md), or [set up a local instance of our curriculum site on your computer](backend/1-installing-a-local-instance.md), or [deploy the application in the cloud](deployment/reclaim-shared-hosting/pull.md).
